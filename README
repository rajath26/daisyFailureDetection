This is the readme file with instructions to use the 'Daisy Distributed System Failure Detection'.

Step 1) Compile
Run the compile.sh script
$ ./compile.sh

Step 2) Start the node
Run the startDaisyFDNode.sh script in src folder.
This script has the following options:
-p : Port Number
-i : IP Address 
-t : Node type which can be: 
     1) "leader"
     2) "member"
-h : Host number
     Each host should be designated a number like '0' or '1' or any integer. When the node is brought down and if it has to join back (reincarnation) then the same host number must be provided 
$ ./startDaisyFDNode -p <port_no> -i <ip_address> -t <node_type> -h <host_num>
